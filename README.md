### What's LavaBukkit?
LavaBukkit is a minecraft server implementation for Forge mods and Spigot mods for 1.12.2. Sponge has come out for this type of implementation, but most features are not available or are simply not able to be done with their API. This also will be constantly updated when Forge or Spigot is updated. We also will not have game-breaking issues much like this type of implementation's 1.7.10 counterpart

We hope to eliminate all issues with craftbukkit forge servers. In the end, we envision a seamless, low lag Spigot and Forge experience.

Advantages over Sponge or other implementations:
+ Lag-lowering optimizations
+ Better world protection (Forge stuff doesn't bypass Bukkit plugins but rather works with it!)
+ Full use of **all** Spigot plugins and Forge mods
+ Hyperthreaded performance
+ Use of Mixin - Unlike other impl.
